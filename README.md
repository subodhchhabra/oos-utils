# OOS Utils

In most applications they're a common set of methods that developers consistently have to re-write. Things such as `is_number(p_string)`, `download_file(p_blob)`, etc. Not only does this add development time to projects, each iteration may have slight differences. The worst is that some of which even have bugs!

Enter OOS Utils. **OOS Utils provides a common set of PL/SQL utility methods that remove the need for the creation of common methods in each application**. Check out the docs below to see the complete list of methods OOS Utils provides. Never re-develop common methods again!

NOTE: OOS Utils is currently in Beta. **Do not install in production.**s
